All of our staff are given in-depth, on-going training to become specialists in our field, able to help clients with any and all of their needs. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: In one word...PERSONALITY! We are an Internet company where our core business helps people with domains, DNS, hosting and SSL. Some previous knowledge of these products is an asset, but not what will make you succeed at Rebel. More important to us is the attitude that behind every problem lies a solution, and the potential to help. The ability to deal with people, to make them feel they are not just a number, but rather a client. MUST-HAVES FOR THIS POSITION: The ability to speak, read and write in English (French is an asset) Flexible schedule - we are open 24/7 WHAT WE OFFER: Rebel celebrates contribution. We work hard and we respect balance. We’re agile, open-concept and collaborative. We stock our kitchen so that you can grab breakfast, lunch, and snacks anytime. We’re smoke-free, but beer heavy, and we’re in the heart of Ottawa’s Byward Market. So if Rebel sounds like the perfect workplace for you, there’s only one question: Why haven’t you applied yet? ABOUT REBEL: We believe those who contribute make us better. It’s why we support thought leaders, web developers, trailblazing businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators to contribute, share, and succeed online with domain names and a broad suite of hosting services. Time and energy go into creating the tools and services that power our customer’s contribution. Like all things Rebel, our work culture invites and inspires, encourages exploration and embraces adaptation. Our manifesto - Be Thoughtful. Be Simple. Be Brave - is woven into the fabric of everything we do, from our robust products to our quirky office traditions. NON-SMOKERS ONLY, PLEASE! Apply for this position','ASDAd','ASDa');
